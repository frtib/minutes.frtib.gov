Extra files when making the ZIPs

There were 2006 attachments but no main PDFs.

2015 Mar - There were two main PDFs.  One was an update and someone (Stef?) copied the update into the folder and pointed to the new one in Cascade but didn't delete the old.  Cascade didn't show extra files.  The newer file was left on the website and the older one is here.
